# jIRCd for JamVM 1.5.0

jIRCd 0.4.1-beta (2004) port for primitive (iPod-2G/iOS-4.2.1) JamVM (jamvm-1.5.0/java-5) systems.

## Changes

* Removes dependencies
* Disables logging

## Setting up/running

Binary included as `jircd.jar`, edit appropriate configs.

## Compiling

Preferably do it inside a container, like [apsl/java5](https://hub.docker.com/r/apsl/java5/dockerfile).

Use `ant` to build a binary.
